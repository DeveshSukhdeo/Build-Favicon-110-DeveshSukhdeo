    <p>First I had to take a screenshot of my favicon and add it to the file. Then I adeed it in the head section. The starting attribute was link then the rel attribute which is the relation, the rel is equal to icon. The next attribute is the type attribute, it is image/png becuase the favicon is a png. the final attribute is the href (hyper refrence) attribute, there I added the png of my favicon that is in the file section.</p> <!--Add a paragraph describing how I added my favicon to the page-->
